                                    As a corporation, we do business with a lot of other corporations. It is only natural, however we tend to do business with corporations
                                    out of the Actee high sec pocket. Why? Well because we have a long history with them, they are right next door, and they are honest
                                    in their dealings.
                                    <br><br>
                                    So why do I bring this up? Well, recently our friends in Actee have been plagued by a war with RIOT. I use plagued relatively loosely, because
                                    really it hasn't caused a whole lot of trouble yet. Well, with this war one of the citadels in the system came under attack. The attacker managed to 
                                    take down the shield timer with little to no resistance, and we were asked to assist with the armor timer.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We take our role in faction warfare and allies to other corps seriously, and when an allied corporation asks for help we will respond. Yesterday we showed
                                    up to defend this citadel with thirty plus alliance members in fleet. Now this may not sound like a whole lot of people in a fleet, however just consider
                                    that the attacking alliance could only field at most 14 pilots (One of their corps left right before this too).
                                    <br><br>
                                    The attacking force did not show up, and the citadel repaired. However, we showed that we value the relationships we have with our allies and that we will
                                    show up and protect them from unjust harm.

                                    The Federal Defense Union (FDU) took action against the State Protectorate last evening. The state was attempting 
                                    to anchor three unknown citadels in Gallente space. These citadels would give them a foothold to attack from, and allow them to take those systems. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    We as part of Federation Uprising could not allow this to happen, and participated in an operation called RED TIGER. We were tasked with destroying 
                                    the first citadel called RED 1. We did this with extreme prejudice and without resistance. Near the end of the destruction of RED 1, we became informed 
                                    that RED 3 was undergoing resistance. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    As soon as we destroyed RED 1 with a ball of drones from our kitey vexor's we moved to Hikkoken to reinforce the fleets there. We arrived on field 
                                    to start attacking the RED 3 citadel. While we were making a decent dent into the citadel, we actually served a greater purpose. As a distraction, 
                                    the Caldari resistance warped over to us. Surely they were thinking that we were an easy target to be dealt with. However, we successfully executed 
                                    a moon walk procedure and left the battlefield. At this time the RED 3 attacking force was able to move in and finish off the Astrahus. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    During this combined op we were able to protect the great citizens of the Gallente Federation. We will stand by our brothers in Federation Uprising, 
                                    and continue to fight off the Caldari oppression.
                                    <br><br>

                                    This month marks a glorious month indeed, as we joined with our brothers to liberate the south from the Caldari oppression. Together with Federation Uprising and
                                    fellow GalMil operatives we beat Black Shark Cult back and out of the south. Not only did we do it, we did it within a two week period. This marks one of the fastest
                                    blitzes ever performed by a militia.
