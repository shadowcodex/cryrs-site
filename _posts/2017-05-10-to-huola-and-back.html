<p>It has been a while since we posted an update to the site, and I think there has 
been enough content to fill a post with. We went to the Amarr and Minmatar Faction
Warfare warzone and just completely dominated the field. We rolled through the 
north warzone within a week, and started a campaign to burn Huola. The campaign
ended last week with the fall of Huola to the Minmatar Republic.

    During this time many dank fights have happened including a massive fight to 
    'defend' a citadel in Old Man Star. The Citadel was anchored to give us some 
    content, and content it did provide. We were severely outnumbered, but managed
    to win the isk war. The isk war was won even including the citadel being lost.
    Below is a video showing that fight from the view point of some logi.

    Now in addition to in game content I have been hard at work updating the website
    and tools. The map is moving "yet again" to it's final resting place at <a href="/t/map/">/t/map/</a>
    in the main JREX domain. This will allow us to track it better and understand how 
    people are using it in relation to the website. Eventually all tools will fall under 
    the same /t/ sub directory.

    We now have a super secret meme generator that if you are in system with us, you 
    may see us throw links up from. I am also in the works of creating our own 
    PI tool to show the quick relationship between different levels of materials
    and planets.

    We are actively recruiting experienced pilots, and if you are interested you should 
    head on over to the <a href="/apply.html">Application page and join up...</a>

    o7 for now.
