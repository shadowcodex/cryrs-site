The Federal Defense Union (FDU) took action against the State Protectorate last evening. The state was attempting to anchor three unknown citadels in Gallente space. These citadels would give them a foothold to attack from, and allow them to take those systems. 
<br><br>
We as part of Federation Uprising could not allow this to happen, and participated in an operation called RED TIGER. We were tasked with destroying the first citadel called RED 1. We did this with extreme prejudice and without resistance. Near the end of the destruction of RED 1, we became informed that RED 3 was undergoing resistance. 
<br><br>
As soon as we destroyed RED 1 with a ball of drones from our kitey vexor's we moved to Hikkoken to reinforce the fleets there. We arrived on field to start attacking the RED 3 citadel. While we were making a decent dent into the citadel, we actually served a greater purpose. As a distraction, the Caldari resistance warped over to us. Surely they were thinking that we were an easy target to be dealt with. However, we successfully executed a moon walk procedure and left the battlefield. At this time the RED 3 attacking force was able to move in and finish off the Astrahus. 
<br><br>
During this combined op we were able to protect the great citizens of the Gallente Federation. We will stand by our brothers in Federation Uprising, and continue to fight off the Caldari oppression.
