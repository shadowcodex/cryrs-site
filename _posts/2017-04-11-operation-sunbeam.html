CRYRS is extending services to the Amarr
<br><br>
Fliet -- for immediate release. After many successful trial runs in Caldari space, 
Cryotech Retrieval Services is officially announcing an extension of services to 
the Amarr. We know that the Amarrian people have very deep pockets and thus will 
not hesitate to pay for our services. Knowing this untapped potential, we have 
arranged for our retrieval specialists to delve into this hostile territory to 
retrieve and return the used clones of the Amarrian people. This service will be 
offered as a trial for 2 weeks before we regroup to analyze our results and 
restructure our methods. This will help us cut costs which will go directly back 
to you!
<br><br>
This operation is without coincidence following the recent announcement by 
Federation Uprising that they would also be diving into Amarrian space, albeit 
with much nobler intentions: the freedom of the oppressed living under the 
Amarrian control. We would be hard pressed to deny that we are capitalizing on 
this venture, knowing full well the casualties that would be suffered by both 
sides. We salute our Matari allies with one hand and extend our valuable services 
to the Amarr with the other.
<br><br>
This venture of ours also serves a twofold purpose. Not only will we profit from 
the spoils of war, but it will allow us to get in close to fire off a few shots 
of our own. As proud Gallente citizens, we reject the oppression of the Amarrian 
people and seek to bring freedom to all people of the galaxy.
