Last night we went on a strat op into enemy territory, to take out some pirates 
and bring down an Azbel's armor timer. They didn't really put up a big fight
and we easily alpha'd their rattlesnakes off the field. Some good gent was kind
enough to record the event and here is the entertainment.

Enjoy
