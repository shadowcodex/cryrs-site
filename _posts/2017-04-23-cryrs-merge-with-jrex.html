Well this is an interesting turn of events. So as of right now CRYRS is merging
into JREX [Jerkasaurus Wrecks Inc.]. We are both small corps, and we believe that
by working together as one and sharing resources we can really achive both
of our visions.

<br>
I'm extremely excited about this venture, and look forward to our continuing partnership
with JREX and FEDUP. For now here is an awesome video!
