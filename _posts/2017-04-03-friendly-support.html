As a corporation, we do business with a lot of other corporations. It is only natural, however we tend to do business with corporations out of the Actee high sec pocket. Why? Well because we have a long history with them, they are right next door, and they are honest in their dealings. 
<br><br>
So why do I bring this up? Well, recently our friends in Actee have been plagued by a war with RIOT. I use plagued relatively loosely, because really it hasn't caused a whole lot of trouble yet. Well, with this war one of the citadels in the system came under attack. The attacker managed to take down the shield timer with little to no resistance, and we were asked to assist with the armor timer. 
<br><br>
We take our role in faction warfare and allies to other corps seriously, and when an allied corporation asks for help we will respond. Yesterday we showed up to defend this citadel with thirty plus alliance members in fleet. Now this may not sound like a whole lot of people in a fleet, however just consider that the attacking alliance could only field at most 14 pilots (One of their corps left right before this too). 
<br><br>
The attacking force did not show up, and the citadel repaired. However, we showed that we value the relationships we have with our allies and that we will show up and protect them from unjust harm.
