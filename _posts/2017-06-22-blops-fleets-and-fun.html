    Hello there citizens of EVE! Should I actually say Pilots of EVE? Well either 
    way hello. Crap that was a really cheesy intro. Anyways, anywho, what was I 
    going to talk about? Oh Yeah
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Blops...</h2>
</p>
<p>
    JREX has officially started to host blop fleets (Black Ops for newbies) on 
    a regularly scheduled basis. This means we are adding even more content for 
    not only JREX but FEDUP as a whole. You are welcome to join in if you are in 
    FEDUP and own a covert ops capable ship. Just incase you don't have one and are
    looking for one to get here are some options.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stealth Bombers</li>
    <li>Astero, Straios, Nestor</li>
    <li>T3 Cruiser like a tengu or proteus configured for covert ops</li>
    <li>Recon Cruisers</li>
    <li>Black Ops Battleships</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As always we are looking for more cap pilots as well. If you have a cap and 
    want to actually use it let us know.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Fleets...</h2>
</p>
<p>
    We have had several fun fleets going out every week over the past month or so.
    These include everything from roams, wormhole dives, null sec fights, citadel 
    timers, and more. We have been slowly pushing while the Caldari still lick 
    their wounds from the early spring push in the warzone. We are hoping they 
    come back at some point and start adding some content and fights. 
</p>
<p>
    <h2>And Fun...</h2>
</p>
<p>
    We have several things going on in addition to eve including a D&D group and 
    some cards against humanity playing. Alcohol and these activities are highly
    recommended to be done together. We will continue to look for new and exciting 
    ways for our pilots to engage with the corp and Alliance as a whole.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>New Corps...</h2>
</p>
<p>
    We have two new corporations that have joined the Federation Uprising and those
    include Align to Valhalla and Alwar Fleet. We welcome these two groups into the 
    fold and look forward to much content and much wow fights!
</p>
<p>
    <h2>New Tool...</h2>
