            <span class="text-info">Ashterothi</span>: "Why are we looking at null?"<br>

        </blockquote>
        <p>So yeah, FEDUP is testing the waters of Null and as such I'd thought 
        this would be a perfect time to write a guide about null. I want our website
        to become both a public face of FEDUP/CRYRS, and a source of information and tools
        for the general public of EVE. I don't claim to be a null expert, but I hope
        I can impart some wisdom on to you.</p>
        <p>One thing to remember is that <span class="text-danger">NULL SEC</span> is a completely different area
        of the game, and comes with different challenges and rewards. Hopefully
        after reading this guide you will be one step closer to being prepared for 
        it. However, the best way to learn is to jump in and do it.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>A Word of Warning To You</h2>
        <p><span class="text-danger">NULL SEC</span> can be a very unforgiving place. If you are new to the game 
        in general, it is not a recommended area for you. You will become easy
        prey for the hunters there, however you can still learn to live.</p>
        <p>The thing to remember is that <span class="text-warning">You Will Die</span>.</p>
        <p>This is only a matter of when, and if you read this guide I hope that
        when will be later rather than sooner. Don't whine, complain, or get mad
        if you die in null. Sit back, look at what happened and learn from it.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Get Ready Before Coming</h2>
        <p>If you just joined, or are looking to join a corp for diving into the 
        null sec empire, pause. You need to get prepared to come into null. The
        only way to do that is to read, read, and read some more. Here are a few
        things you should do before jumping into null.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Read this guide in full.</li>
            <li>Read all your corp bulletins. You can find these under the corporation
            window in the home tab. CORP>HOME>BULLETINS. If you are part of an 
            alliance then read the alliance bulletins as well. Your new corp/alliance
            should be providing you with all the information you need to know before
            heading up there.</li>
            <li>Know where you are going, and plan a path. I'll cover ways to get
            into null later, but you need to have a plan.</li>
            <li>Learn the surrounding area via dotlan.</li>
            <li>Learn where all your available jump bridges are, as this can make
            travel in your area a lot faster.</li>
            <li>Find out if there are common gate camps on your routes, and be prepared
            both mentally and ship wise.</li>
            <li>Learn how to use dscan, and know some pvp basics.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Pay Attention</h2>
        <p>I cannot stress this enough. <span class="text-success"><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong></span>... <span class="text-success"><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong></span>... <span class="text-success"><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong></span>...
        If you cannot do this simple thing, then don't even bother coming into 
        <span class="text-danger">NULL SEC</span>. There is a plethora of information
        available to every capsuleer in EVE, and it can be overwhelming at times.
        However if you can't take time to sort through it, then don't come. There are 
        minimal levels of awareness that are required to not get killed every minute
        of everyday. Specifically there are two places you should always be keeping
        an eye on.</p>
        <h3> 1. Intel Channel</h3>
        <p>If you are part of a coalition or major alliance you should have a dedicated
        intel channel for your area. A lot of times it will be streaming with tons
        of information. This is where knowing your area comes into play, as you need
        to be able to quickly see if a system reported is near you. Using the intel
        you can see if the group is heading towards you or away, and if they are 
        heading towards you, get safe.</p>
        <p>If your intel channel is anything like mine it will look something 
        like this: </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            [02:32] <span class="text-warning">Valindil89</span>: 3KNA Asterothi Ares<br>
            [02:33] <span class="text-warning">Gimli</span>: ME- Asterothi Ares<br>
            [02:56] <span class="text-warning">Valindil89</span>: BKG-0 Kontraband Derptron
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>If you notice it follows a very simple format here which is "<span class="text-info">SYSTEM - PILOT NAME - SHIP THEY ARE FLYING</span>".</p>
        <p>Watching this information can save your life, literally.</p>
        <h3> 2. Local Channel</h3>
        <p>One of the worst things that can happen to you as a ratter or miner in 
        <span class="text-danger">NULL SEC</span> is a neutral pilot randomly showing
        up in your system. If you didn't see them on intel this could be alarming for
        a few reasons. (a) They could have logged off in this system, and just logged in. 
        (b) They are moving fast enough that they slipped past someone, so they are 
        likely in an interceptor. (c) They just popped out of a WH that is in system,
        which means they know how to probe and can probe you down.</p>
        <p>None of these situations can you control, but you need to be able to react.
        You should have your dscan open to keep an eye on incoming space, and know if they
        are headed towards you. You should be aligning out of your position to a safe 
        somewhere. Finally you should be recalling any drones you have.</p>
        <p>If they show up on your descan before you get your drones in, leave them.
        To me it is better to leave your drones than give this neut a killmail.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Keeping Safe</h2>
        <p>Just a quick tip about how to keep safe with neuts in the system. 
        If you have access to a citadel, then tether up or dock up. If you have 
        access to a station then dock up. If you don't have access to either, then
        you should have several safe spots already made in the system. You should
        begin bouncing between these spots and not staying in any one point long 
        enough to allow them to scan you down.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Interceptors, Interdictors and Bubbles</h2>
        <p>These things are baddies in <span class="text-danger">NULL SEC</span>. Most
        likely one of these things will be the reason you die. </p>
        <h3> 1. Interceptors</h3>
        <p>Interceptors are some of the fastest ships in the game. They are Tech 2
        frigates that have role bonuses to allow them to be effective tacklers. Not
        only do they (a) move fast and (b) tackle well, they are immune to warp disruption
        bubbles. They still cannot warp when tackled by a warp distruptor or scrambler, however
        they will fly through gate bubbles like they weren't there. This allows them to move
        extremely fast through null, often times making 30+ jumps in under 5 minutes.
        If you see interceptors heading your way in intel, just go ahead and start getting
        safe. They will be in system and on you faster than you can imagine.</p>
        <h3> 2. Interdictors and Bubbles</h3>
        <p>These are Tech 2 destroyers that will ruin your day. They have the ability
        to launch warp discruption bubbles that block warping in a 20k radius from the 
        probe. Nothing can warp out of these bubbles, no matter how many stabs are fitted
        to the ship. The only exception to this are interceptors, nullified t3cs, and yachts.
        If you see one of these, run. "Sebre" seems to be the popular choice in my
        neck of the woods.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Blues VS Neutrals</h2>
        <p>The area I live in is coalition owned, and thus there are lot's of blues. 
        This makes it a tad bit more safe, and one can get a little to relaxed in 
        the area. Blues are alliances, corps, and players that you have worked out 
        a relation ship with to trust them not to shoot you. This doesn't mean that 
        100% of the time they won't shoot you, it just means you pseudo trust them 
        not too. Anyone who isn't blue to you is a neutral and should be treated as
        an aggressing enemy. The real difference between blues and neuts though is that
        with blues you have a channel to go to and yell at someone. Usually you can 
        resolve the issue and possibly get an isk compensation for your loss. Neuts, you
        are just shit out of luck. So if it is not blue, shoot it. AKA <span class="text-info">NBSI</span>.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Coalition, Alliances, and Corps</h2>
        <p>So you may have heard me mention coalition a few times. If you are part of one 
        you most likely know what I am talking about, however if you aren't then you 
        might have zero clue. Like an alliance which is a group of corporations, a 
        coalition is a group of alliances. Coaltions are usually managed by setting 
        +10 standings with other alliances and helping each other to maintain sov
        in an area. It really is just another level of organization above an alliance.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Wormholes</h2>
        <p>In high sec and low sec, you may not pay much attention to wormholes. 
        They may seem like an ellusive object that people in eve talk about. In 
        <span class="text-danger">NULL SEC</span> that is a different story. I treat
        wormholes like cancer, and so do most null groups. IF you see a wh, keep 
        very close attention to local as it gives an unmonitored entrance into your
        system. Most of the ships that come through it will be covert ops cloaked (aka cloaky black ops bullshit), 
        and you won't see them coming. You're only warning is your anaomaly probe 
        window, and local chat. If you are part of an alliance with sov, then they 
        will normally work together to "roll" or close these wormholes. This prevents
        unwanted neutrals from entering the system/pocket.</p>
        <p>If the wormhole is not a direct-to-highsec wormhole then my alliance/coalition's 
        policy is to roll it. It won't stay around for long.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Getting To Your Home</h2>
        <p>Getting out into your home in <span class="text-danger">NULL SEC</span> 
        can be challenging for a new player. I usually recommend a few different
        ways. And they are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Death Clone: Your corp should have an office in their system, set
            your death clone to that office and suicide yourself. Instant warp into
            pocket. You don't need to bring anythign with you except isk anyways. A 
            good corp will have supplies for you to purchase / use there.</li>
            <li>Wormhole: Find a direct connection wormhole to your pocket.</li>
            <li>Tavel Interceptor: Gate jump the whole way in a travel ceptor.</li>
            <li>Yacht: Grab a luxury yacht and gate jump the whole way there.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>For now I have imparted a little bit of wisdom on you, and I hope you heed 
        my advice. If I think of more things to add, I will revisit this guide and 
        updated it with new sections. I'll keep a change log at the bottom of 
        the page so you can see how recently it was updated.</p>
